\begin{abstract}
\textit{We compare the predictions of the GUMICS$-$4 global magnetohydrodynamic model for the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere with Cluster~SC3 measurements for over one year, from January 29, 2002, to February 2, 2003. In particular, we compare model predictions with the north/south component of the magnetic field ($B_{z}$) seen by the magnetometer, the component of the velocity along the Sun-Earth line ($V_{x}$), and the plasma density as determined from a top hat plasma spectrometer and the spacecraft's potential from the electric field instrument. We select intervals in the solar wind, the magnetosheath, and the magnetosphere where these instruments provided good quality data and the model correctly predicted the region in which the spacecraft is located. We determine the location of the bow shock, the magnetopause and, the neutral sheet from the spacecraft measurements and compare these locations to those predicted by the simulation.}
  
\textit{The GUMICS$-$4 model agrees well with the measurements in the solar wind however its accuracy is worse in the magnetosheath. The simulation results are not realistic in the magnetosphere. The bow shock location is predicted well, however, the magnetopause location is less accurate. The neutral sheet positions are located quite accurately thanks to the special solar wind conditions when the $B_{y}$ component of the interplanetary magnetic field is small.}

%\section*{Plain Language Summary}
%We compare output from a model for the Earth's space environment with the spacecraft observations of the magnetic field strength and direction, solar wind velocity, and two different density measurements over the course of 1 year. We select intervals from locations in regions near Earth where the spacecraft instruments provide high quality data and the model correctly predict the region in which the spacecraft is located. We identify the locations where the spacecraft observes boundaries between different regions and compare these locations to those predicted by the simulation. The model agrees well with the measurements in the solar wind, but its accuracy diminishes in the slower, thermalized, and compressed flow around the region dominated by the Earth's magnetic field. In this region, the model does not seem to be realistic. The locations of the boundaries are generally good, but predictions for the location of the boundary of the region dominated by the terrestrial magnetic field and the domain of the slower, compressed solar wind stream are less accurate.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%One of the most cost-effective ways to study the interaction of the solar wind with planetary magnetospheres (or predict conditions in near-Earth space) is modeling this complex system using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In the past, several parallelized codes were developed, which are used for forecasting the near-Earth space environment. Such as the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry \citep[LFM;][]{lyon04:_lyon_fedder_mobar_lfm_mhd} code, the Grid Agnostic MHD for Extended Research Applications \citep[GAMERA;][]{zhang19:_gamer}, the Open Geospace General Circulation Model \citep[OpenGGCM;][]{raeder08:_openg_simul_themis_mission}, or the Block-Adaptive-Tree-Solarwind-Roe-Upwind-Scheme \citep[BATS-R-US;][]{powell99:_solut_adapt_upwin_schem_ideal_magnet,toth12:_adapt}. In Europe three global MHD codes have been developed: the Grand Unified Magnetosphere--Ionosphere Coupling Simulation \citep[GUMICS$-$4;][]{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}, the Computational Object--Oriented Libraries for Fluid Dynamics \citep[COOLFluiD;][]{lani12:_coolf_open_comput_platf_aerot} and the 3D resistive magnetohydrodynamic code Gorgon \citep{chittenden04:_x_z,ciardi07}. The COOLFluiD is a general-purpose plasma simulation tool. The Gorgon code was developed to study high--energy, collisional plasma interactions and has been adapted to simulate planetary magnetospheres and their interaction with the solar wind \citep{mejnertsen16:_global_mhd_neptun,mejnertsen18:_global_mhd_simul_earth_bow}. Neither Gorgon nor COOLfluid has an ionospheric solver. Almost all of these codes are available at the Community Coordinated Modelling Center (CCMC; http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) hosted by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) or the Virtual Space Weather Modelling Centre (VSWMC; http://swe.ssa.esa.int/web/guest/kul-cmpa-federated; requires registration for the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Space Weather (SWE) portal) hosted by the KU Leuven \citep{poedts20:_virtual_space_weath_model_centr}. A comparison of the simulation results with spacecraft and ground-based measurements is necessary to understand the abilities and features of the developed tools. A statistical study using long--term global MHD runs for validation of the codes seems necessary. Because providing long simulations is costly and time--consuming, only a few studies have been done, almost all for periods much less than a year except \citep{liemohn18:_real_time_swmf_ccmc}.


%\citep{guild08:_geotail_lfm1,guild08:_geotail_lfm2} launched two months of LFM runs and compared the plasma sheet properties in the simulated tail with the statistical properties of six years of Geotail magnetic field and plasma observations \citep{kokubun94:_geotail_magnet_field_exper,mukai94:_low_energ_partic_lep_exper_geotail_satel}. The LFM successfully reproduced the global features of the global plasma sheet in a statistical sense. However, there were some differences. The predicted plasma sheet was too cold, too dense, and the bulk flow was faster than the observed plasma sheet \citep{kokubun94:_geotail_magnet_field_exper,mukai94:_low_energ_partic_lep_exper_geotail_satel}. The LFM overestimated the ionospheric transpolar potential. The transpolar potential correlated with the speed of the plasma sheet flows. Equatorial maps of density, thermal pressure, thermal energy and, velocity were compared. The LFM overestimated the plasma sheet density close to the Earth, the temperature by a factor of $\sim$3 and the global average flow speed by a factor of $\sim$2. The LFM reproduced many of the climatological features of the Geotail data set. The low-resolution model underestimated the occurrence of the fast earthward and tailward flows. Increasing the simulation resolution resulted in the development of fast, bursty flows. These flows influenced the statistics and contributed to a better agreement between simulations and observations.

%\citep{zhang11:_lyon_fedder_mobar_mhd} studied the statistics of magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling using the LFM simulation of \citep{guild08:_geotail_lfm1} above. The polar cap potential and the field--aligned currents (FAC), the downward Poynting flux and, the vorticity of the ionospheric convection were compared with observed statistical averages and the Weimer05 empirical model \citep{weimer05:_improv_joule}. The comparisons showed that the LFM model produced quite accurate average distributions of the Region 1 (R1) and Region 2 (R2) currents. The ionospheric R2 currents in the MHD simulation seemed to originate from the diamagnetic ring current. The average LFM R1 and R2 currents were small compared with the values from the Weimer05 model. The average Cross Polar Cap Potential (CPCP) was higher in the LFM simulation than the measurements of the SuperDARN and the Weimer05 model. The average convention pattern was quite symmetric in the LFM simulation as compared to the SuperDARN measurements and the Weimer05 model. The SuperDARN measurements and the Weimer05 model had a dawn-dusk asymmetry. In the LFM model, more Poynting flux flowed into the polar region ionosphere than in the Weimer05 model as a consequence of the larger CPCP in the LFM simulation. The larger CPCP allowed a higher electric field in the polar region. The statistical dependence of the high-latitude convection patterns on Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) clock angle was similar to the SuperDARN measurements \citep{sofko95:_direc_super} and the Weimer05 model. The average ionospheric field-aligned vorticity showed good agreement on the dayside. However, the LFM model gave larger nightside vorticity than SuperDARN measurements because the Pedersen conductance on the night side ionosphere was too low. 

%\citep{wiltberger17:_struc_high_latit_curren_magnet_ionos_model} studied the structure of high latitude field-aligned current patterns using three resolutions of the LFM global MHD code and the Weimer05 empirical model \citep{weimer05:_improv_joule}. The studied period was a month$-$long and contained two high-speed streams. Generally, the patterns agreed well with results obtained from the Weiner05 computing. As the resolution of the simulations increased, the currents became more intense and narrow. The ratio of the Region 1 (R1), the Region 2 (R2) currents and, the R1/R2 ratio increased when the simulation resolution increases. However, both the R1 and R2 currents were smaller than the predictions of the Weimer05 model. This effect led to a better agreement of the LFM simulation results with the Weimer~2005 model results. The CPCP pattern became concentrated in higher latitudes because of the stronger R2 currents. The relationship of the CPCP and the R1 looked evident at a higher resolution of the simulation. The LFM simulation could have reproduced the statistical features of the field$-$aligned current (FAC) patterns. 

%\citep{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar} simulated the month of January 2005 using the Space Weather Modelling Framework \citep[SWMF;][]{toth05:_space_weath_model_framew} and the OMNI solar wind data (https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/) as input. The simulations were executed with and without an inner magnetosphere model and using two different grid resolutions in the magnetosphere. The model was very good in predicting the ring currents \citep[SYM-H; http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aeasy/asy.pdf;][]{iyemori90:_storm}. The $K_p$ index (a measure of the general magnetospheric convention and the auroral currents \citep{bartels39,rostoker72:_geomag,thomsen04:_why_kp}) was predicted well during storms however the index was overestimated during quiet periods. The AL index (that describes the westward electrojet of the surface magnetic field introduced by \citep{davis66:_auror_ae}) was predicted reasonably well on average. However, the model reached the highest negative AL value less often than it was reached in observations because the model captured the structure of the auroral zone currents poorly. The overpredicting of $K_p$ index during quiet times might have happened for the same reason because it is also sensitive to auroral zone dynamics. The SWMF usually over$-$predicted the CPCP. These results were not sensitive to grid resolutions, except for of the AL index, which reached the highest negative value more often when the grid resolution was higher. Switching the inner magnetosphere model off had a negative effect on the accuracy of all quantities mentioned above, except the CPCP. 

This paper compares the Cluster SC3 measurements directly to a previously made 1-year long GUMICS$-$4 simulation at locations in the solar wind, magnetosheath, and the magnetosphere along the Cluster SC3 orbit \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. %The parameters are $B_z$, the north/south component of the magnetic field in GSE coordinates, the solar wind velocity GSE X component ($V_x$), and the solar wind density $n$. We also compare the predicted and observed locations of the bow shock, magnetopause, and the neutral sheet. These parameters are selected because $B_z$ controls the solar wind--magnetosphere interaction, $V_x$ is the main component of the solar wind velocity and $n$ is the ion plasma moment that is the easiest to calculate; furthermore, several instruments could determine it (see Section~\ref{sec:cluster}).
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes the GUMICS$-$4 code, the 1-year simulation, and the Cluster spacecraft measurements. Section~\ref{sec:comp} gives comparisons between the simulations and observations. Results of the comparison are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:concl} contains the conclusions.

\section{The GUMICS$-$4 products and Cluster measurements}
\label{sec:data}

%Here we use two very different time series. The first type is derived from a previous 1-year run of the GUMICS$-$4 simulation \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. The second time series was measured by the magnetometer, ion plasma, and electric field instruments of the Cluster reference spacecraft.

%\subsection{The GUMICS$-$4 code}
%\label{sec:gumics}

%The GUMICS$-$4 model has two coupled simulation domains, the magnetospheric domain outside of a 3.7\,$R_E$ radius sphere around the Earth, and a coupled ionosphere module containing a 2D height-integrated model of ionosphere. GUMICS$-$4 is not a parallel code model however it has been extensively used to study energy propagation from the solar wind into the magnetosphere through the magnetopause and other features \citep[see the references therein]{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}. The code has also been applied to study forced reconnection in the tail \citep{voeroes14:_winds_condit_ram_co_ram}. Recently, several hundred synthetic two hours duration GUMICS$-$4 simulation runs were made to compare the simulation results to empirical formulas \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd}. The agreement was quite good in general, but the diameter of the magnetopause in the simulations deviated slightly (10\,\%) from corresponding observations in the tail. The GUMICS$-$4 simulation magnetotail was smaller than that which the spacecraft observed. However, the modeled magnetopause showed good agreement with the empirical model in the mid--tail at northward IMF conditions. \citep{facsko16:_one_earth} made a 1-year long simulation using the GUMICS$-$4 code. In those simulations, the magnetotail was significantly shorter than that which the spacecraft observed \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} and \citep{voeroes14:_winds_condit_ram_co_ram} had similar experience when the simulations of the papers were evaluated. \citep{juusola14:_statis_gumic_mhd} compared the ionospheric currents, fields and the Cross Polar Cap Potential Drop (CPCP) in the simulation to observations from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars \citep{greenwald95:_darn_super} and CHAMP spacecraft \citep{reigber02:_champ} observations of field--aligned currents (FAC) \citep{juusola07:_hall_peder_champ,ritter04:_ionos_champ_image}. The CPCP, the FAC, and other currents could not be reproduced properly. A possible cause for this poor agreement could be the model's low resolution in the inner magnetosphere and/or the lack of an inner magnetosphere model accurately incorporating the physics of this region. This hypothesis is supported by the result of \citep{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar}. \citep{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar} simulated only a month--long period using a different spatial resolution and tested the code with the inner magnetosphere model of the SWMF switched off for a special run. This run without an inner magnetosphere model made it clear that only the CPCP parameter of the simulation agreed quite well with the measurements. This fact explained why the agreement between the Cluster SC3 and the GUMICS-4 simulations was so good as described by \citep{lakka18:_cross_polar_cap_satur_gumic,lakka18:_icme_earth_mach} based on the CPCP in GUMICS$-$4 simulations. \citep{kallio15:_proper} determined plasma and magnetic field parameters along the lunar orbit from \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}'s global MHD simulations. The parameters differed significantly from observations in the magnetotail indicating the need for future studies. \citep{facsko16:_one_earth} determined the footprint of Cluster SC3 using the 1-year simulation and the Tsyganenko T96 empirical model \citep{tsyganenko95:_model_earth}. The agreement of the footprint was better in the Northern Hemisphere. The GUMICS$-$4 tail was shorter in the simulations than the observations. 

A 1-year global MHD simulation was produced with the GUMICS$-$4 code using the OMNI solar wind data from January 29, 2002, to February 2, 2003, as input \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. The creation and analysis of the simulation were based on a work package of the European Cluster Assimilation Technology (ECLAT) project (https://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/165813\_en.html; http://www.eclat--project.eu/). %The GUMICS-4 is a serial code \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd} hence the 1-year simulation was made in 1860 independent runs. This interval covered 155 Cluster SC3 orbits and each orbit lasted 57 hours. The FMI supercomputer at the time had 12 cores on each node hence the 57 hours were divided into 4.7 hours simulation time with one hour initialization period. Each sub-interval used its own individual average Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) IMF magnetic field X component $B_x$ component and dipole tilt angle. All data gaps in the solar wind were interpolated linearly. If the data gap of the input file was at the beginning (or the end) of the interval then the first (or last) good data from the input file was used to fill the gap. The initialization of each simulation run was made using constant values. These values were the first valid data of the input file repeated 60 times (60 minutes) in the input file of the sub-interval. The simulation results were saved every five minutes. Various simulation parameters, for example, the density, particle density, temperature, magnetic field, solar wind velocity (29 different quantities) were saved from the simulation results along the Cluster reference spacecraft's orbit in the GSE coordinates. 

%\subsection{The Cluster SC3 measurements}
%\label{sec:cluster}

The Cluster-II mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) was launched in 2000 to observe geospace \citep{credland97:_clust_mission,escoubet01:_introd_clust}. The four spacecraft form a tetrahedron in space however here we use only the measurements of the reference spacecraft, Cluster SC3. %The spacecraft was spin--stabilized and its rotation period is $\sim$4\,s. Hence, the intrinsic time resolution of the plasma instruments is 4\,s and we use 4\,s averaged magnetic field data. The highest resolution of the Cluster FluxGate Magnetometer (FGM) magnetic field instrument is 27\,Hz \citep{balogh97:_clust_magnet_field_inves,balogh01:_clust_magnet_field_inves}. The ion plasma data are provided by the Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS) Hot Ion Analyser (HIA) sub-instrument \citep{reme97:_clust_ion_spect_exper,reme01:_first_earth_clust_cis}. The CIS HIA instrument is calibrated using the Waves of HIgh frequency Sounder for Probing the Electron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) wave instrument onboard Cluster \citep{decreau01:_early_whisp_clust,trotignon10:_whisp_relax_sound_clust_activ_archiv,blagau13:_in_hot_ion_analy_clust,blagau14:_in_hot_ion_analy_clust}. The results of these calibrations can appear as sudden non-physical jumps in the CIS HIA data. The CIS HIA had different modes to measure in the solar wind and the magnetosphere. When the instrument is switched from one mode to another mode non-physical jumps also appear in the measurements. These features impair the accuracy of data analyses.

We remove non-physical jumps from our results using a density determination based on different principles. %We use the spacecraft potential of the Electric Field and Wave Experiment \citep[EFW ;][]{gustafsson97:_elect_field_wave_exper_clust_mission,gustafsson01:_first_clust_efw} to determine the electron density. This quantity can be calculated using the empirical density formula 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:empdens}
%n_{EFW}=200(V_{sc})^{-1.85},
%\end{equation}
%where $n_{EFW}$ is the calculated density and $V_{sc}$ is the Cluster EFW spacecraft potential \citep{trotignon10:_whisp_relax_sound_clust_activ_archiv,trotignon11:_calib_repor_whisp_measur_clust}. The EFW and the WHISPER were used for the calibration of the CIS HIA and the Plasma Electron and Current Experiment \citep[PEACE;][]{johnstone97:_peace,fazakerley10:_peace_data_clust_activ_archiv,fazakerley10:_clust_peace_in_calib_status}. Both instruments were still working onboard all Cluster spacecraft. Their stable operation reduced the number of data gaps, and it also made the data analysis easier.

\section{Comparison of measurements to simulation}
\label{sec:comp}

The parameters saved from the GUMICS$-$4 simulations and the Cluster SC3 magnetic field, solar wind velocity and, density measurements are compared in different regions, namely the solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetosphere via cross$-$correlation calculations. %The temporal resolution of the simulated Cluster orbit data is mostly five minutes because the results of the simulations are saved every five minutes \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. However, the time difference between points can be more than five minutes at the boundary of the subintervals, because the length of the simulation intervals is determined in minutes. To facilitate analysis of the simulation results, all simulation data were interpolated to a one$-$minute resolution. This method does not provide extra information to the cross$-$correlation calculation. The data gaps are eliminated using linear interpolation and extrapolation when the gap is at the start or the end of the selected interval. The spin resolution (4\,s) of Cluster SC3 magnetic field measurements is averaged over five minutes around ($\pm150\,s$) the timestamps of the saved data. Then the averaged data were interpolated to a one$-$minute resolution to make the correlation calculations.

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,angle=0]{mufcikk-f04}
\caption{Scattered plots of the Cluster SC3 and GUMICS$-$4 simulations for all intervals in the solar wind. The dashed line is the y=x line. (a) Magnetic field Z component in GSE system. (b) Solar wind velocity X component in GSE system. (c) Solar wind density measured by the CIS HIA instrument (red) and calculated from the spacecraft potential (blue).}
\label{fig:swscatplot}
\end{figure}

For the correlation calculation, intervals are selected carefully in the solar wind (see Section~\ref{sec:sw}), the magnetosheath (see Section~\ref{sec:msh}), the dayside and the night side magnetosphere (see Section~\ref{sec:msph}). In these intervals, the parameters did not vary a lot and we exclude intervals when either Cluster or the virtual probe cross any boundaries. To compare the $B_z$ magnetic field, $V_x$ solar wind speed and the $n_{CIS}$ and the $n_{EFW}$ curves we cross--correlate selected intervals. %We carefully examine such cases, and remove intervals that are shorter than four hours for the $\pm$60\,minutes correlation calculation, and intervals with large data gaps from the correlation calculation. Those intervals are also excluded when the plasma instrument has a calibration error or a change in its recording mode as it moves from the magnetosphere to solar wind (for example). The electron density is also calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:empdens} and correlated. We want to avoid the calibration errors and sudden non-physical jumps mentioned previously. The correlation results for the density derived from the electric field potential results do not differ significantly from those for the top hat plasma instrument, however, the EFW's $n_{EFW}$ experiences no mode changes and it is applicable in the magnetosphere too (in contrast to the CIS HIA instrument).

%\subsection{Solar wind}
%\label{sec:sw}

We use OMNI IMF and solar wind velocity, density, and temperature data as input to the simulation. %Comparing parameters obtained from the simulation and the measurements in the solar wind region is especially interesting because the IMF X component cannot be given to the GUMICS$-$4 as input \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd,facsko16:_one_earth}. However, the magnetic field of the solar wind has an X component in the simulations. Additionally, solar wind structures might evolve from the simulation domain boundary at +32\,$R_E$ to the sub-solar point of the terrestrial bow shock where all OMNI data is shifted. Almost the same solar wind time intervals are used as in Table~1 of \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. %Although the Cluster instruments were calibrated in 2002, just after launch, there are not many CIS HIA moment observations in 2001 and 2002 (Table~\ref{tab:sw}). Hence, we do not have satisfactory ion plasma data coverage for this year. Additionally, to improve the accuracy of the correlation calculation (see below) we omitted intervals (shorter than five hours) and those in which the CIS HIA instrument changed its mode. The Cluster fleet is located in the solar wind only from December to May and only for a couple of hours during each orbit near apogee. We double$-$check whether Cluster SC3 remains in the solar wind in both the simulation and reality. We also check the omnidirectional CIS HIA ion spectra on the Cluster Science Archive (CSA; https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa/csds-quicklook-plots). The spectra must contain one narrow band in the solar wind region, indicating an observation of the solar wind beam.
Hence, there are only 17 solar wind intervals to study, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sworbit}. 

The selected intervals occur for quiet solar wind conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:swomni}). The GUMICS$-$4 simulation results have five--minute time resolution and the Cluster SC3 measurements have one--minute time resolution (Figure~\ref{fig:swplot}). The measurements vary significantly. Despite the quiet conditions the observed solar wind density often changes and deviates from the simulation. Figure~\ref{fig:swscatplot}c shows that both densities deviate significantly. The CIS HIA density variations are even larger as expected given the complexity and a large number of working modes of the CIS instrument. The magnetic field and the solar wind velocity fit better. Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}a shows that the correlation of the magnetic fields is very good; furthermore on Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}c,~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}e,~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}g the correlation of the solar wind velocity and density is excellent (Table~\ref{tab:sw}). The time shift in Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}b, Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}d, Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}f is about five--minutes for the magnetic field and the CIS data. In Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}h for the EFW data, the time--shift is less stable. It is not as well determined as in the case of the other parameters.

%\subsection{Magnetosheath}
%\label{sec:msh}

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,angle=0]{mufcikk-f09}
\caption{Scattered plots of the Cluster SC3 and GUMICS$-$4 simulations for all intervals in the magnetosheath in GSE system. The dashed line is the y=x line. (a) Magnetic field Z component. (b) Solar wind velocity X component. (c) Solar wind density measured by the CIS HIA instrument (red) and calculated from the spacecraft potential (blue).}
\label{fig:mshscatplot}
\end{figure}

Cluster SC3 spent only a little time in the solar wind from December 2002 to May 2003. However, the spacecraft enters the magnetosheath in each orbit (Figure~\ref{fig:mshorbit}). %We select intervals when the value of the magnetic field is around 25\,nT. The field should be fluctuating because of the turbulent deflected flow of the shocked solar wind the temperature should be greater than that in the solar wind. The velocity should decrease to values ranging from 100-300\,km/s. The density of the plasma should increase and reach values of 10-20\,cm\textsuperscript{-3}. The narrow band on the omnidirectional CIS HIA ion spectra from the CSA (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa/csds-quicklook-plots) widens from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. 15--30\,minutes from each bow shock crossing we considered the Cluster SC3 to have entered into the magnetosheath. At the inner magnetopause boundary of the magnetopause the flow speed and the density drop. The magnetic field strength increases and the magnetic field becomes less turbulent than in the magnetosheath. The wide band in the omnidirectional CIS HIA ion spectra disappears, indicating the plasma has undergone heating. 15-30 minutes before (or after) the appearance of these indicators of the magnetopause crossing our intervals end. All intervals containing large data gaps, non-physical jumps in instrument modes or lasting less than four hours are removed.
Hence, 74 intervals considered in our final selection (Table~\ref{tab:msh}). 

All intervals have quiet upstream (or input) solar wind conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:mshomni}). Despite our selected quiet magnetic field and plasma parameters, the calculated empirical density indicate that they vary significantly stronger than in the solar wind intervals (Figure~\ref{fig:mshplot}). The deviation between the simulated and the observed data is also larger in this region than in the solar wind region. The scatter plots of the magnetic field, plasma flow speed, and the densities show that these parameters agree well, but with a greater variation than the scatter plots for the same parameters in the solar wind (Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}a,~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}b,~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}c). The correlation of the simulated and the observed data is good for the magnetic field (Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}a), very good for the ion plasma moments and the calculated density (Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}c, ~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}e, ~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}g). The timeshift of the magnetic field is within five minutes mostly (Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}b) however the timeshift of the ion plasma moments is scattered (Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}d,~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}f). The timeshift of the calculated EFW density seems to be more stable (Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}h). Generally, the GUMICS$-$4 is less accurate in the magnetosheath than in the solar wind. The modeled magnetic field is better predicted than the modeled plasma parameters are. The calculated empirical EFW density ($n_{EFW}$) fits better than the CIS HIA density ($n_{CIS}$).

%\subsection{Magnetosphere}
%\label{sec:msph}

%We select intervals in the magnetosphere based on the CIS HIA omnidirectional ion flux spectrum. The magnetosphere is defined by the disappearance of hot magnetosheath ion population. The plasma density decreases toward zero, the magnetic field strength becomes great. We eliminated 15--30\,min after/before the magnetopause transition to identify magnetosphere intervals. This way we found 132 intervals of which we found 132 (Table~\ref{tab:msph}) using Cluster SC3 measurements. Cluster SC3 spends considerable time in the magnetosphere (Figure~\ref{fig:msphorbit}). 

Here we show neither any correlation calculation nor comparison plot. In the magnetosphere, the GUMICS$-$4 does not work well. Neither the magnetic field nor the plasma moments nor the $N_{EFW}$ fit well. The solar wind velocity does not reach zero in the simulation. Instead, the solar wind enters the night side magnetosphere. The solar wind CIS HIA ion plasma density and the calculated density from spacecraft potential increase closer to the Earth (plasmasphere). The GUMICS$-$4 density is low there. We calculated the dipole field in GSE using Tsyganenko Geotool box \citep{tsyganenko95:_model_earth} and subtracted from both the observed and the simulated magnetic field $B_z$ data. The correlation of these corrected magnetic field measurements and simulations is very low too. 

%\subsection{Bow shock, magnetopause, neutral sheet locations}
%\label{sec:bs}

We selected 77 intervals when Cluster SC3 crossed the terrestrial bow shock once or multiple times (Table~\ref{tab:bs}). %When the spacecraft crosses the bow shock inbound the magnitude of the magnetic field and the solar wind density increases by a factor to 4--5 (from 5\,nT or 5\,$cm^{-3}$, respectively), the solar wind speed drops from 400--600\,km/s to 100--300\,km/s; furthermore the narrow band in the omnidirectional Cluster CIS HIA ion spectra widens. Both the Cluster measurements and the GUMICS$-$4 simulations have 5--min resolution and are interpolated to 1--min resolution.
All bow shock transitions of the virtual spacecraft are slower and smoother. Additionally, GUMICS-4 does not predict multiple bow shock transitions. The code reacts slowly to such sudden changes. The magnetic signatures fit better than the calculated plasma moments. The jump of the ion plasma parameters and the derived Cluster EFW density of the simulations are shifted to the measurements. Generally, the density and the velocity of the simulations seem to be less accurate than the magnetic field in the simulations.

54 intervals are selected around magnetopause crossings (Table~\ref{tab:mp}). %When the spacecraft crosses the magnetopause inbound the magnitude of the magnetic field increases, the solar wind speed drops from 100--300\,km/s to zero, the plasma density becomes zero; furthermore the wide band on the omnidirectional Cluster CIS HIA ion spectra disappears.
The location of the magnetopause is well determined by the Cluster SC3 measurements. However, it is very difficult to identify the magnetopause crossings in the simulation data. The magnetopause crossings usually (92\,\%) cannot be seen in the simulations. The magnetopause crossings are not visible in $V_{x}$ and n. This observation is independent of the IMF orientation. Or when the magnetopause crossings are identified in both simulations and spacecraft measurements the events are shifted in time and location. The accuracy of the model is lower for the dayside magnetopause locations than the bow shock locations.

\label{fig:nsplot}
\end{figure}

Nine intervals are chosen around Cluster SC3 neutral sheet crossings (Figure~\ref{fig:nsorbit}; Table~\ref{tab:ns}). %The neutral sheet locations are determined using the results of the Boundary Layer Identification Code (BLIC) Project (E.~I.~Tanskanen, private communication, 2015). The BLIC code determines the neutral sheet crossing Cluster FGM magnetic field measurements using \citep{wang94:_signat}'s method. When the solar wind speed is very low around the currents sheet in the simulation space; furthermore the CIS HIA density and the EFW calculated density are very low near the current sheet too; finally the GSE Z component of the magnetic field changing is a sign of the code--indicated neutral sheet crossing (Figure~\ref{fig:nsplot}; red and blue curves).
The neutral sheet crossings are visible in the GUMICS simulations (Figure~\ref{fig:nsplot}; black curves). For five events (from nine Cluster SC3 crossings) the GUMICS$-$4 also provides similar smoothed parameters and change of sign of the $B_{z}$ component. This is an outstanding result because the tail in the GUMICS$-$4 simulations is significantly smaller than observed in reality \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd,facsko16:_one_earth}; furthermore the solar wind enters the tail in MHD simulations generally \citep{kallio15:_proper}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The agreement of $B_{z}$, $V_{x}$ and $n_{EFW}$ in the solar wind with the similar GUMICS simulation predictions is very good (Figure~\ref{fig:swscatplot}a,~\ref{fig:swscatplot}b,~\ref{fig:swscatplot}c,~blue). The agreement of $n_{CIS}$ is worse (Figure~\ref{fig:swscatplot}c,~red). It was expected because the $n_{EFW}$ depends on the spacecraft potential provided by the EFW instrument. However, the CIS instrument has many modes for measuring the plasma parameters and it needs periodic calibration too. The correlation of the solar wind $V_{x}$, $n_{CIS}$ and $n_{EFW}$ with the similar GUMICS simulation parameters is greater than 0.9 (Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}c,~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}e,~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}g). The correlation of the $B_{z}$ is also greater than 0.8 (Figure~\ref{fig:swcorrplot}a). The upstream boundary of the GUMICS$-$4 code lies at $32\,R_E$ \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}, the nose of the terrestrial bow shock is at about $20\,R_E$. If the solar wind speed is 400\,km/s, then this spatial distance means less than a 5\,minutes delay, so it should not be visible in the time delays from the cross--correlations. %80\% of the intervals support this theory but 20\,\% do not. In these cases, the one-minute resolution $B_z$, $n_{CIS}$ or the $n_{EFW}$ parameters have a sudden jump or variation that the simulation cannot follow, or the resolution of the simulation output (5\,minutes) is too small to see these variations. Therefore, the correlation calculation is not accurate in these cases. %Previously the OMNI data was compared to the Cluster data and the Cluster measurements were compared to the GUMICS$-$4 \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. The comparison suggests that the GUMICS$-$4 results should be similar to the OMNI data. Furthermore, we calculate correlation functions in the solar wind, where there is no significant perturbation of the input parameters in the simulation box. Therefore, we get the expected result after comparing the two different correlation calculations.

In the magnetosheath we get worse agreement with the GUMICS simulation data (Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}a,~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}b,~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}c). While the parameters are correlated, the scatter is greater. The general reason for this larger uncertainty seems to be that the magnetosheath is turbulent. This phenomenon explains the higher variations of the $B_{z}$ magnetic field on Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}a. The solar wind $V_{x}$, $n_{CIS}$ and $n_{EFW}$ agree better than the magnetic field component (Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}b,~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}c). Here there is no deviation between the densities derived in different ways ($n_{CIS}$ and $n_{EFW}$) on Figure~\ref{fig:mshscatplot}c. Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot} seems to contradict these statements above. The larger uncertainty of the $B_{z}$ is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}a. However, that correlation is still good in Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}b. The other parameters have larger ($]0.9$) correlation in Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}c,~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}e,~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}g. However, the time shifts in Figure~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}d,~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}f,~\ref{fig:mshcorrplot}h seem to be worse. Here the time shifts are worse because the shape of the time series in the magnetosheath looks very smooth and similar hence there are not enough points to get a sharp and large maximum correlation as the function of timeshift. The difference between the minimum and the maximum of the correlation is small compared with the uncertainty of the calculation. The maximum, the timeshift could be anywhere and the shape of the correlation vs.~timeshift function is often neither symmetric nor does it have only one local maximum. Hence, the correlation calculation provides larger time shifts for the ion plasma parameters and the $n_{EFW}$. 

In the magnetosphere, the GUMICS$-$4 does not work well. GUMICS$-$4 uses a tilted dipole to describe the terrestrial magnetic field \citep{janhunen12:_gumic_mhd}. After removing the magnetic dipole from the magnetic field measurements of the Cluster SC3 and the simulation we get very low correlations and unacceptable time shifts (not shown). The tilted dipole is an insufficient description of the inner magnetospheric magnetic field. The plasma moments and the $n_{EFW}$ do not fit either. The single fluid, ideal MHD does not describe the inner magnetosphere well therefore $V_{x}$ and $n$ in the simulations do not agree with $V_{x}$, $n_{CIS}$ and the $n_{EFW}$ measured by the Cluster SC3. Within the $3.7\,R_{E}$ domain ring current physics must be added, as it has been in other global MHD codes \citep[for example][]{toth12:_adapt}. %This can explain the limited accuracy of the cross--polar cap potential (CPCP) and geomagnetic indices of the GUMICS simulations \citep{juusola14:_statis_gumic_mhd}. The CPCP GUMICS agrees well with spacecraft measurements therefore this quantity could be used for simulation studies \citep{lakka18:_cross_polar_cap_satur_gumic}. \citep{haiducek17:_swmf_global_magnet_simul_januar} also compared geomagnetic indices and the CPCP. The Space Weather Modelling Framework (SWMF) was tested. When the inner magnetosphere model was switched off in the simulation only the comparison of the simulated and observed CPCP was good. Therefore, the reason for the discrepancy of the geomagnetic indices in the GUMICS simulations must be the missing inner magnetosphere model.

The bow shock positions agree in the GUMICS simulations and the Cluster SC3 measurements. However, the magnetopause locations do not match as well as the bow shock in simulations and observations. In simulations the location of the magnetopause is determined from peaks in currents density, particle density gradient, or changes in flow velocity \citep[see references therein]{siscoe01:_magnet_fluop,garcia07:_findin_lyon_fedder_mobar,gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd}. Here the previously saved simulation parameters along the virtual Cluster SC3 orbit are analyzed. %The $J_{y}$ current density component cannot readily be determined from measurements by a single spacecraft. Therefore, the above--mentioned methods cannot be applied.
This discrepancy of the magnetopause location agrees with the results of \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} and \citep{facsko16:_one_earth}. \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} compared synthetic GUMICS runs with an empirical formula for the magnetopause locations. \citep{facsko16:_one_earth} used OMNI solar wind data as input and got the same result as \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd} and this paper. The neutral sheets are visible in both simulations and observations (Figure~\ref{fig:nsplot},~Table~\ref{tab:ns}). This experience is exceptional because the night side magnetosphere of the GUMICS$-$4 simulations is small and twisted \citep{gordeev13:_verif_gumic_mhd,facsko16:_one_earth}. However, in these cases, the IMF has no large $B_{y}$ component. From \citep{facsko16:_one_earth} we know that the GUMICS has a normal long tail (or night side magnetosphere) if the $B_{y}$ is small. The code can identify the bow shock transitions. For the magnetopause and the neutral sheet, the results are more complex.

\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

Based on the previously created 1-year long GUMICS$-$4 run global MHD simulation results are compared with Cluster SC3 magnetic field, solar wind velocity, and density measurements along the spacecraft orbit. Intervals are selected when the Cluster SC3 and the virtual space probe are situated in the solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetosphere; firthermore their correlation is calculated. Bow shock, magnetopause, and neutral sheet crossings are selected and their visibility and relative position are compared. We achieved the following results:
\begin{enumerate}
%  \setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
  \setlength{\parskip}{-3pt}
\item In the solar wind the correlation coefficient of the $B_{z}$, the $V_{x}$, the $n_{EFW}$ and the $n_{CIS}$ are larger than 0.8, 0.9, 0.9 and 0.9, respectively. The agreement of the $B_{z}$, the $V_{x}$, and the $n_{EFW}$ is very good, furthermore the agreement of the $n_{CIS}$ is also good. 
\item In the magnetosheath the correlation coefficient of the $B_{z}$, the $V_{x}$, the $n_{EFW}$ and the $n_{CIS}$ are larger than 0.6, 0.9, 0.9 and 0.9, respectively. The agreement of the magnetic field component, the ion plasma moments, and the calculated empirical density is a bit weaker than in the solar wind. The $V_{x}$, the $n_{EFW}$ and the $n_{CIS}$ fits better than the $B_{z}$ component in the magnetosheath. Their agreement is still good. The reason for the deviation is the turbulent behavior of the slowed down and thermalized turbulent solar wind.
\item In neither the dayside nor the nightside magnetosphere can the GUMICS$-$4 provide realistic results. The simulation outputs and the spacecraft measurement disagree in this region. The reason for this deviation must be the missing coupled inner magnetosphere model. The applied tilted dipole approach is not satisfactory in the magnetosphere at all. 
\item The position of the bow shock and the neutral sheet agrees well in the simulations and the Cluster SC3 magnetic field, ion plasma moments, and derived electron density measurements in this study. The position of the magnetopause does not fit that well.
\end{enumerate}
The GUMICS$-$4 has scientific and strategic importance for the European Space Weather and Scientific community. This code developed in the Finnish Meteorological Institute is the most developed and tested, widely used tool for modeling the cosmic environment of the Earth in Europe. An inner magnetosphere model should be two--way coupled to the existing configuration of the simulation tool to improve the accuracy of the simulations.
